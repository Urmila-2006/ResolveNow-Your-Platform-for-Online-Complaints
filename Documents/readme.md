Complaint Management System – Project Documentation

This project titled "Complaint Management System" is developed to provide an effective and user-friendly platform for registering and managing customer complaints through an online system. The main purpose of this project is to replace the manual complaint handling process with a digital solution that improves efficiency and transparency.

In this system, customers can create an account and log in securely to submit their complaints. After submitting a complaint, the information is stored in the database. The administrator can view all the complaints through the admin dashboard and assign them to agents for further processing.

The assigned agent can view the complaint details and update the complaint status after working on the issue. Once the problem is resolved, the complaint is marked as completed by the administrator. Customers can log in at any time to check the progress of their complaints.

The system consists of three main modules which are the customer module, admin module, and agent module. Each module has its own functionalities to ensure proper complaint handling and management.

The frontend of this application is developed using React.js along with HTML and CSS to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js to handle the server-side logic and API requests. MongoDB is used as the database to store user details and complaint information.

This project helps in improving the communication between customers and administrators by providing a centralized platform for complaint registration and resolution. It also ensures accountability and reduces the time required for resolving issues.

The system has been tested for proper functioning of login authentication, complaint submission, complaint tracking, assignment, and resolution processes.

This project can be further enhanced by adding features such as email notifications, priority-based complaint handling, and report generation.
