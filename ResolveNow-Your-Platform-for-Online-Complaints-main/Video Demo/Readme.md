Complaint Management System

This project is a web-based Complaint Management System developed to make the process of registering and resolving customer complaints easier and more organized. In many organizations, complaints are still handled manually which may lead to delays and mismanagement. This system helps in overcoming those problems by providing an online platform where users can submit complaints and track their status.

The system allows customers to create an account, log in securely, and register their complaints. Once a complaint is submitted, it is stored in the database and can be viewed by the administrator. The administrator can review the complaint details and assign it to an agent for resolution. The assigned agent can update the complaint progress and mark it as resolved once the issue is solved.

Users can log in at any time to check the status of their complaints such as pending, in progress, or resolved. This improves transparency between the users and the organization.

This application is developed using React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database.

To run the project:

Step 1:
Clone the repository

git clone <repository link>

Step 2:
Install frontend dependencies

cd client
npm install
npm start

Step 3:
Install backend dependencies

The main objective of this project is to provide a digital solution for complaint handling which improves efficiency and ensures timely resolution of user issues.
